<p class="usa-prose-width">As required by the Evidence Act/CIPSEA 2018, a standard application process (SAP) to apply for access to confidential data assets was developed by the ICSP. This SAP will continue to evolve over time to address issues and new or emerging needs, and will continue to require engagement from leaders across the Federal statistical system and the broader Federal data ecosystem.</p>

    <h3 class="font-serif-lg margin-left-1">Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence building</h3>
</div>

<p class="usa-prose-width">The Evidence Act implemented approximately half of the recommendations produced by the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (CEP). The CEP was established in 2016 and delivered a report in 2017 to the President and to Congress containing 22 recommendations to encourage: (1) Systematic Planning for Evidence-Building, (2) High Quality Data Governance, and (3) Coordinated Support for Privacy-Protected Data Sharing. To advise OMB on implementation of some Evidence Act requirements, and to refine other recommendations from the CEP, Congress included a requirement in the Evidence Act to stand up the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building (ACDEB). The ACDEB was tasked to review, analyze, and make recommendations on how to promote the use of Federal data for evidence building. Its duties included advising the CSOTUS and ICSP on implementation of Title III of the Evidence Act, known as the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2018 (CIPSEA 2018). The ACDEB delivered its final report to OMB in October 2022.</p>
