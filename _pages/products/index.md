Accordingly, this process is designed exclusively for statistical purposes – that is, not for regulatory, enforcement, program administration, or other non-statistical purposes. Comments are due by August 12, 2024, and can be submitted on <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link--external">regulations.gov</a> under Docket ID “<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/BLS-2024-0001-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link--external">BLS-2024-0001</a>”.
