<p>Laws, policies, and guidance help the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States (OCSOTUS), the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP), and other leaders and members of the statistical system coordinate statistical work across the Federal Government. This ensures the creation of relevant, timely, credible, and cohesive statistical information is created to inform evidence-based decision-making, while protecting the responses of individual data providers.</p>

<p>Major laws, policies, and guidance often apply to one or more phases or aspects of the information lifecycle &mdash; planning, data acquisition, providing access, and disseminating the resulting information.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant laws, policies, and guidance are presented below organized according to phases in the information lifecycle:</strong> cross cutting (span the full information lifecycle); information collection; confidentiality, data access, and data sharing; and data dissemination.</p>

<h2 class="font-serif-lg">Cross Cutting</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title44/chapter35/subchapter1&edition=prelim" class="usa-link--external" target="_blank">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (codified as amended at 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520)</a> provides for the coordination of Federal information policy. Among other things, it establishes the role of the CSOTUS and the ICSP, and enumerates the responsibilities and authorities bestowed on them. It also governs information creation, collection, disclosure, maintenance, use, sharing and dissemination by or for the Federal government.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=%2Fprelim%40title44%2Fchapter35%2Fsubchapter3&edition=prelim" class="usa-link--external" target="_blank">Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2018 (codified at 44 U.S.C. 3561–3583) or CIPSEA 2018</a> (pronounced sip-c), also known as Title III of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, reaffirms and expands CIPSEA 2002. Among other things, it codifies the fundamental responsibilities of Federal statistical agencies and units to ensure public trust, and gives statistical agencies and units responsibilities and authorities to facilitate more effective evidence building.</p>
